I'm forwarding this here because it has some possible implications for
those running FTP archives with crypto software -- mind you, I'm an
engineer (well, when I graduate next year) by profession, so my
interpretations don't come from legal training [ie. a disclaimer].

Because of a misconception of my own about export regulations, I spoke
to the Defence Signals Directorate and the Defence Industry Policy and
Operations Division (DIPOD) (and a letter to the Attorney General's
Dept and DoTC -- related more to the use of encryption technology over
Australian comms lines when I was researching for radio show [I see
from the archives that this debate has already occured]) in the last
two weeks.  I also looked at the appropriate acts and regulations that
cover this area, so to summarise some salient points:

1.  

The Defence Industry Policy and Operations Division will supply you
with (though mine came by way of their Industry Development Div) a
document titled "Australian Controls on the Export of Technology with
Civil and Military Applications -- A guide for Exporters and
Importers", September 1992. This summaries the restrictions on `Dual
Use Technology' exports (part of adherence to COCOM) and includes
section 5 on `Telecommunications and "Information Security"'. Part 2,
sections 5.A.2 and 5.D.2 deal with cryptographic hardware and software
(respectively).

2. 

Conversation with DSD and DIPOD reveals that all software is controlled
on a end user country basis (once you have authority for a country,
individual end user permission is just "red tape").  My post on this:

I since found out, after talking to DIPOD, that the general software
note only covers software not specifically required for the products
functionality, I suppose like an operating system (?) [we had to have
workstations approved for export to china where I last worked, they
didn't seem to care about the OS, it was the "RISC" technology that
was the concern -- and led us to drop from HP 700's to 400's, ick!].

It also turns out that specific applications (banking and financial)
have a relatively easy approval process, but unknown ones require you
to supply details of functionality, and they'll ask you questions.
It appears that they have some "rough" guidelines about what to export
and what not to export, "Key management" being OK, but "communications
security products", well ..

Note the implications for export via the Internet though, the reply
I received (after stating that I was an independant software developer
and interested in releasing a "limited functionality" version via the
Internet) was almost a standover.

Because of this, I went to the law section of my library (a real fun
place!) to find out what legs it all stands on.

3. 

The legal basis for this is embedded in the `Customs (Prohibited
Exports) Regulations' "in force under the Customs Act 1901". I looked
at all amendments up to and including 242(1994).

Section 13B deals with items under Schedule 13 which are prohibited
unless permission in writing has been granted by the Minister of State
for Defence or an authorised person. Further subsections make note of
time limits that may be applied, and revokation due to non-compliance.

"Schedule 13, Part 2" contains "Complete or partially complete
cryptographic equipment designed to ensure the secrecy of
communications" (in various mediums, video, data, telephony, fax) "or
stored information" and "Software" performing these functions, and
"applications software for cryptographic or cryptanalytic purposes"
etc. There are some 10+ items in this schedule, others deal with
frequency agile modulation systems (Spread-Spectrum) and multi-level
security/compartmentalisation software.

As if this didn't squash the issue, Section 13E makes provisions to
allow the Minister of State for Defence (or someone he/she authorises
in writing) to control "The exportation from Australia of goods
specified in the document published by the Minister of State for
Defence entitled `Australian Controls on the Export of Technology with
Civil and Military Applications' dated September 1992". There are lots
of subregulations to deal with not re-exporting from the destination
country, ability for revokation [this time it can be arbitrary!],
verification of compliance and so on -- about 2 pages in total.

This completes the "trail" of legality.

4.

The Attorney General's Dept stated that "he was aware" that these were
the only controls on the export of cryptographic products, actually,
I'll include the relevant bits from my query and his response:

5.

The DoTC gave me almost exactly the same reply as Ian has noted earlier
(from archives), ie. encryption over telecommunications carriers is OK
provided that if it is carried out by a "carrier" itself, then provisions
must be made to allow access under the Telecommunications (interception)
Act.

I'd be interested on any related information in this area, it's become
a "hobby horse" of mine :-).
