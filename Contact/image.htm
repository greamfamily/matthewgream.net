<b>Phonebox (a.k.a "Kiosk")</b>
</p>

<p>
This classic red phone box is one of the most recognisable icons of Britain.
</p>

<p>
The British Post Office held a design competition in 1924 for a new kiosk,
judged by the Fine Arts Commission and won by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott.
Named Kiosk No. 2, or K2, it was deployed across London and other large
cities in 1927.
</p>

<p>
In the same year, the Post Office Engineering Department designed
the larger K4, based upon K2, containing a posting box and stamp selling machine:
they were expensive, unsuccessful and subsequently cancelled in 1935 with
only 50 produced.
</p>

<p>
In 1929, the K3 was introduced, designed also by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott,
and intended for scenic and special sites, and also general outdoor use
in both rural and urban areas. It became the standard for rural areas in
1930. Whereas the K2 was built from cast iron, the K3 was made from
concrete - which proved to be a poor material for this use and was not
used for any later designs.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, the K5, a transportable plywood version of the K3 was
created for use at exhibitions and for other temporary needs.
</p>

<p>
The K6 was introduced in 1936 to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of the
coronation of King George V. It was similar to the K2, and also designed
by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. As a result of active deployment programmes
across 1936 and 1937, over 9,000 K6's were installed all over the country
making it the first genuinely standard kiosk, which continues to be
recognised as a british icon to this day.
</p>

<p>
The K7 of 1962 by Neville Comber was a failure. The subsequent K8
of 1968 by Douglas Scott and Bruce Martin became the successor to the
K6 for all replacements and new installations.
</p>

<p>
In 1985, the K8 was superceded by the KX100-400 series - the first truly
modern designs - which reached total deployment of 80,000 by 1996. In 1996,
the KX+ range was introduced based on extensive user requirements research:
it reflected the character of tradtional K6 design, but incorporated modern
materials, anti-valdalism and numerous other features.
</p>

<p>
By the late 1990's, the heritage value of the K6 had been realised,
and a policy was developed to retain and reintroduce them where
practical. By 1999 there were over 15,000 K6 boxes in heritage sites.
Since 1997 the K6 trademark has been available for license to
competitors provided colours other than red are used - largely as a
concession to avoid problems with restrictive trade practices.
</p>

<p>
In sum, the work by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott (incidently, whose grandfather
was also a famous architect) illustrates the power of a successful design,
one which can survive the test of time, and be reborn as a distinctive
heritage artifact. Undoubtedly the K6 is recognisable across the world.

<b>Postbox (a.k.a. "Letter Box")</b>
</p>

<p>
Although not as universally recognisable as the phone box, the british post box
is nevertheless distinctive in style.
</p>

<p>
The first independent letter boxes (those not at a place of residence,nor at a post
office itself) were installed from 1853, with the first London pillar box installed
in Fleet Street in 1855. Initially coloured Green, they were changed to Red in 1874,
but a further 10 years passed until older boxes were repainted.
</p>

<p>
They are tpyically found as pillar boxes (free standing), wall boxes (fixed into a wall
such that only the front is visible) or a lamp boxes (attached to a pole or lamp post).
The wall box (depicted) was installed from about 1857.
